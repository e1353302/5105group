# Machine Learning Model Training and Optimization

This folder contains all the **code and result files** related to the training, tuning, and optimization processes of machine learning prediction models. It includes scripts for data preparation, model implementation, and hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. You will also find optimization methods such as feature selection and cross-validation strategies to enhance model performance and reduce overfitting. The folder provides detailed experiment logs, including model configurations, tuning steps, performance evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE), and insights from the results.
