# Emission Factors for Activity-Based Calculator

This folder contains international and local emission factors required for the first activity-based calculator. These factors are used to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on various activities. Each emission factor corresponds to a specific resource or activity, providing standardized values to ensure consistency in emission calculations.

## Contents

- **International Emission Factors**: Includes globally recognized emission factors for general activities, applicable across multiple regions.
- **Local Emission Factors**: Contains region-specific emission factors that reflect local environmental conditions and regulatory standards. These factors are essential for accurate calculations within specific geographical areas.

## Emission Factors Included

1. **Water Use**: Emission factors for calculating emissions based on water usage (e.g., kg CO₂e/m³).
2. **Electricity Use**: Emission factors for electricity consumption, considering both global and local power generation profiles (e.g., kg CO₂e/kWh).
3. **Gas Use**: Emission factors for natural gas usage, covering different regions (e.g., kg CO₂e/t).
4. **Wastewater Treatment**: Emission factors specific to wastewater treatment processes, available for both international and local contexts (e.g., kg CO₂e/m³).

## Usage

These emission factors can be referenced directly within the activity-based calculator to standardize GHG calculations. For detailed information on how each factor is applied, please refer to the project documentation or consult the specific calculation sections in the calculator code.
